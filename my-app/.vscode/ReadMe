1- Please start the app by using 'npm i' and then 'npm start'.
2- In this task I used functional component with hooks.
3- I used useMemo as the computed dataset is somehow complex. So it is better to memorize the result in case of same parameters.
4- I used tslinter and eslinter to find errors faster and easier.

note:
5- I started the task yesterday due to tight deadlines in my work so I didn't finish all the requirments.
6- I've never used react with type script before, but it was nice. Thank you :).
